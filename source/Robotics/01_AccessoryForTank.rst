.. Note::
 
 * The standard length for the two types of caterpillar TC-09 AND TC-03, and their size are the same show as follows.
   80cm*4.5cm (length*width);
 * The stripping ways for the caterpillar are the same;
 * The difference for TC-09 AND TC-03 is for the middle. For TC-03 has two small holes, while TC-09 JUST has one small holes;
