:Date:   2018-03-30


In this part, we will present the Assembling manual for the robot tank chassis. But, 
if you cannot find the manual of your chosen tank chassis, please read the related documents,
since, in fact, these tank chassises are very similar, just the looking shapes are different.
Any problem, please contact me: yichone@doit.am.
