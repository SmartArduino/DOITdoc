User Manual for ESP-S
==============================

Introduction
------
The WiFi module ESP-M is manufactured by using a high-performance chip ESP8285. This small chip is encapsulated an enhanced Tensilicaâ€™sL106  diamond series 32-bit kennel CPU with a SRAM. Thus, ESP8285 has the complete function Wi-Fi function; it not only can be applied independently, but can be used as a slaver working with other host CPU. When ESP8285 is applied as a slaver, it can start from the onboard Flash.  The built-in high-speed buffer is not only benefit to improve the system performance, but optimize the store system. In addition, ESP8285 can be used as Wi-Fi adapter by SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interface, when it is applied to other MCU design.

The ESP-M module supports the standard IEEE802.11 b/g/n/e/i protocol and the complete TCP/IP protocol stack. User can use it to add the  WiFi function for the installed devices, and also can be viewed as a independent network controller.  Anyway, ESP-M module provides many probabilities with the best price.
